Machines are an integral TTB feature, which allow you to automate even more vanilla processes!

## Interface
All TTB machines that have a UI consist of 1 slot for [wire color modification](#wire-color) and 5 slots for [modification crystals](#modifications).

## Modifications
A machine's UI contains 5 modification slots to the right. These can contain any combination of [Amethyst](Amethyst), [Vulcaanium](Vulcaanium), or [Mysterious](Mysterious_Crystal) Crystals in order to modify how the machine works.

### Ascension
Machines can be ascended by placing [Vulcaanium Crystals](Vulcaanium_Crystal) in any modification slot. Ascending a machine enhances its abilities, such as making a [Breaker](Breaker) break more blocks, or an [Acronite Cage](Acronite_Cage) throw further.

### Reduction
Machines can be reduced by placing [Amethyst Crystals](Amethyst_Crystal) in any modification slot. Reducing a machine reduces its [Tempite](Tempite) cost by a certain amount.

### Mysteriosity
Machines can be made 'mysterious' by placing [Mysterious Crystals](Mysterious_Crystal) in any modification slot. Making a Machine mysterious will alter its abilities to be more useful or drastically more effective, such as an [Alchemy Chamber](Alchemy_Chamber) throwing the {% include mcwiki.html url="Wither" title="Wither effect" %} instead of the default {% include mcwiki.html url="Poison" title="Poison effect" %}.

### Wire Color
Machines can be made to only be powered by a certain wire color. This can be done by placing a colored pane in the leftmost slot.
